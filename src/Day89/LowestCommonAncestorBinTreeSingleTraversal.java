//Given a binary tree (not a binary search tree) and two values say n1 and n2, write a program to find the least common ancestor.
//Let T be a rooted  The lowest common ancestor between two nodes n1 and n2 is defined as the lowest node in T that has both n1 and n2
//as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).
//The LCA of n1 and n2 in T is the shared ancestor of n1 and n2 that is located farthest from the root.
//Computation of lowest common ancestors may be useful, for instance, as part of a procedure for determining the distance between pairs of nodes in a tree:
//the distance from n1 to n2 can be computed as the distance from the root to n1, plus the distance from the root to n2,
//minus twice the distance from the root to their lowest common ancestor.

//Method 2 (Using Single Traversal)

/*
Method 1 finds LCA in O(n) time but requires three tree traversals plus extra spaces for path arrays. If we assume that the keys n1 and n2 are present
in Binary Tree, we can find LCA using a single traversal of Binary Tree and without extra storage for path arrays.
The idea is to traverse the tree starting from the root. If any of the given keys (n1 and n2) matches with the root,
then the root is LCA (assuming that both keys are present). If the root doesnâ€™t match with any of the keys, we recur for the left and right subtree.
The node which has one key present in its left subtree and the other key present in the right subtree is the LCA.
If both keys lie in the left subtree, then the left subtree has LCA also, otherwise, LCA lies in the right subtree.
